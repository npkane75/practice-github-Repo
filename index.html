    <p>018 Model

        Processor 2.7Ghz i7 (quad core I believe?)
        16gb Memory 2133MHz
        500GB SSD
        I fail to believe that my laptop is 'too slow' to handle two screens as I have the one of the best specced Macbook Pros (13") available. 
        So my question is why can't my computer handle two external screens? 
        I use it for music production and massive projects, but it noticeably slows down when theres nothing open. E.g even as simple as opening chrome or noticing mouse lag the moment the laptop gets plugged in to the screens.
